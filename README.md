## Overview

From the Alacritty [website](https://alacritty.org/index.html)

> Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but allows for extensive configuration. By integrating with other applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to provide a flexible set of features with high performance.

By default, Alacritty does not have support for applying different themes, color configuration is instead set in the config file.
The [`alacritty-theme`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme) provides such theme configurations, but changing the theme has to be done manually in `alacritty.toml`.

This tool emulates theme support for Alacritty by managing the theme configuration import in using Alacritty's configuration:

```toml
# in ~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/my-theme.toml
[colors.primary]
background = '#282c34'
foreground = '#abb2bf'
[colors.normal]
black = '#1e2127'
red = '#e06c75'
green = '#98c379'
#...

# in ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml
import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/my-theme-name.toml" # ðŸ‘ˆ this line is added and managed by alacritty-theme-switcher
]
```
